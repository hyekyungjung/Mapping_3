# Practise 1: Bash Command

- Graphical-User Interface, or GUI
- Windows users can follow along by installing popular shells such as Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com/) or Git Bash https://gitforwindows.org/.
- Goals:
  * navigate through your file system and find files
  * open them, perform basic data manipulation tasks such as combining and copying files
  * reading them and making relatively simple edits
- Open shell:
  * `Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal`
- change the default visual appearance of the terminal in Preferences.
- `whoami`
- Moving Around Your Computer’s File System
  * `pwd`
  * `ls`
  * `man ls` and leave with `q`
  * `ls *.txt` (* command is a wildcard)
  * `ls -l` more information about items
  * `cd desktop`
  * `cd ..`
  * `cd --` goes back to the home directory
  * `open .` open up your GUI at the current directory
- Interacting with files
  * `pwd`, `ls`, `cd Documents`
  * `mkdir DHPracticum` and `ls`

# Wget
- Check if you have it: `wget -V` see if you have it installed.
- In Mac,
  * install Homebrew: `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
  * `brew install wget`
- In Windows:
  * Go to `https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/`
  * Copy the `wget.exe` file into your `C:\Windows\System32` folder.
  * Open the command prompt (`cmd.exe`) and run `wget` to see if it is installed.

# Exercice with -wget
  * `wget http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2600/2600-0.txt`
  * `open 2600-0.txt`
  * `cat 2600-0.txt`
  * `head 2600-0.txt`
  * `tail 2600-0.txt`
  * `mv 2600-0.txt tolstoy.txt` change name
  * `cp 2600-0.txt tolstoy.txt` make a copy
  * `cp tolstoy.txt tolstoy2.txt`
  * `cat tolstoy.txt tolstoy2.txt` prints, or displays, the combined files within the shell
  * `cat tolstoy.txt tolstoy2.txt` > tolstoy-twice.txt
  * `cat *.txt > everything-together.txt` would put all txt files together
  * `rm tolstoy.txt`

- Editing files with vim
  * `vim tolstoy.txt`
  * `Ctrl+F` (that is, holding down your ‘control key’ and pressing the letter F) will move you down a page ( Shift+UpArrow for Windows).
  * `Ctrl+B` will move you up a page. ( Shift+DownArrow for Windows users).

  3. Open the file with your editor of choice, like the Visual Studio Code.
  4. Open the file with your web browser. What do you see? What's the problem?
