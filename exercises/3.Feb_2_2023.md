# Practise 1: Bash Command

- Graphical-User Interface (GUI) VS Terminal/Command line/ Bash
- Windows users can follow along by installing popular shells such as Cygwin (<https://www.cygwin.com/>) or Git Bash <https://gitforwindows.org/>.
- Goals:
  * Navigate through your file system: where are you, what's in the folder.
  * Open, create, delete files and folders
  * Perform basic data manipulation tasks such as combining and copying files
  * Reading them and making relatively simple edits
- Open shell:
  * `Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal`
- Change the default visual appearance of the terminal in Preferences (choose your color, a clear readable font).
- Get to know yourself: `whoami`
- Moving around your computerâ€™s file system:
  * `pwd`
  * `ls`
  * `man ls` and leave with `q`
  * `ls *.txt` (* command is a wildcard)
  * `ls -l` more information about items
  * `cd desktop`
  * `cd ..`
  * `cd --` goes back to the home directory
  * `open .` open up your GUI at the current directory
- Interacting with files
  * `pwd`, `ls`, `cd Documents`
  * create a new directory: `mkdir DHPracticum` and `ls`
  * create a new file: `touch`, e.g. `touch new_file.txt`
  * `open new_file.txt`
- Edit your file in you text editor 

# Install Wget
- Check if you have it: `wget -V` see if you have it installed.
- In Mac (nb. sometimes the terminal ask you to write some additional command, read it through, copy and paste):
  * Install Homebrew: `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
  * Install Wget: `brew install wget`
- In Windows:
  * Go to `https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/`
  * Copy the `wget.exe` file into your `C:\Windows\System32` folder.
  * Open the command prompt (`cmd.exe`) and run `wget` to see if it is installed.

# Exercise 1 with -wget and other commands 
  * Write in your terminal this to download this file: `wget http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2600/2600-0.txt`
  * `open 2600-0.txt`(opens the file)
  * `cat 2600-0.txt` (preview the file)
  * `head 2600-0.txt` (preview the begining of the file)
  * `tail 2600-0.txt` (preview the end of the file)
  * `mv 2600-0.txt tolstoy.txt` (change name)
  * `cp 2600-0.txt tolstoy.txt` (make a copy)
  * `cp tolstoy.txt tolstoy2.txt` (copy a file into another)
  * `cat tolstoy.txt tolstoy2.txt` (prints, or displays, the combined files within the shell)
  * `cat tolstoy.txt tolstoy2.txt` > tolstoy-twice.txt (make one single file from two)
  * `cat *.txt > everything-together.txt` (put all txt files together)
  * `rm tolstoy.txt`
