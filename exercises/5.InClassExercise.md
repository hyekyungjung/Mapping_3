### Thursday, March 2nd 2023 

This Thursday we will have an in class exercise to make sure that all of you are on the same page and have learnt what we have done until now. You will have 45 minutes to complete the different steps. Here are the different steps you must complete: 

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in. Then in your Repositories tab, create a new repository in your account of [GitHub](https://github.com/) with the name `DHExercise`. In description you can add `Exercise in class on Thursday March 2nd, 2023`. Don't forget to `Add a README file`. 

>> Tip: Where it says `This will set main as the default branch. Change the default name in your settings.` Click on `Settings" and in the `Repository default branch` where it says `main`, write `gh-pages`. Go back to your repository tab where you where creating the new repository and refresh it. This will automatically publish the repo in GitHub Pages. 

2. In this new repository, add and create a new markdown file called `index.md` this text in markdown should be marked to get an output similar to this (use bolds, italics, etc.).

3. In your repository, go to `Settings` and make sure that your page is active on GitHub Pages (Settings > Pages). If it is not, just select in `Branch` the `main` option. The result should be visible at:  <https://yourusername.github.io/DHExercise/>.
