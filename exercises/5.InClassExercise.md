### Thursday, March 2nd 2023 

This Thursday we will have an in class exercise to make sure that all of you are on the same page and have learnt what we have done until now. You will have 45 minutes to complete the different steps.

#### GITHUB and GitHubPages

I. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in with your username and password. Then in your Repositories tab, create a new repository and name it `DHExercise`. In the field Description you can add `Exercise in class on Thursday March 2nd, 2023`. Don't forget to `Add a README file`. 

>> Tip: Where it says "This will set `main` as the default branch". Change the default name clicking in "Settings"; once there, in the "Repository default branch" where it says `main`, write `gh-pages`. Go back to your repository tab where you where creating the new repository and refresh it. This will automatically publish the repo in GitHub Pages. 

II. In this new repository, add and create a new markdown file called `index.md`. For now, you can add this text (at the end of the exercise you will edit it again).

```md
# Exercise done in class on Thursday March 2nd, 2023 

At the end of the class your write a final thought on the course and on the work that we have been doing so far.

```

III. In your repository, go to `Settings` and make sure that your page is active on GitHub Pages (Settings > Pages). If it is not, just select in `Branch` the `main` option. The result should be visible at:  <https://yourusername.github.io/DHExercise/>. 

#### HTML and CSS 

IV. Now, we will work in your terminal to download one single file: [exercise2.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/susannalles/DHPracticum_Spring23/gh-pages/exercises/5.exercise2.html). In your terminal, situate yourself in our DHPracticum folder or create a new one for this exercise. 

>> Remember: `pwd` `ls` and `cd` will help you navigate the terminal. 

Once you are inside your folder, you will download the html version of the file with [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/).  Go to your terminal and run the command `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/susannalles/DHPracticum_Spring23/gh-pages/exercises/5.exercise2.html --output-document exercise2.html`

V. Edit the HTML file using all these elements: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, and others you might wish. The goal is to edit this recipe: <https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023232-french-toast?action=click&module=RecipeBox&pgType=recipebox-page&region=all&rank=3>. Here you have the text to include in your file: 

```txt
French Toast

Time: 10 minutes
    
Crackling around the edges and crisp on the outsides with pudding-soft centers, these thin slices of French toast taste like bread pudding, and feel especially like dessert if you smother them with maple syrup, jam or other sweet toppings. The key is to fully soak the bread, then cook the slices gently, so the insides cook through without the outsides burning. If the bread starts to brown too quickly, turn down the heat. You can double, triple or quadruple the amounts below to make enough for friends. Serve them in batches straight from the pan, or keep warm in a 200-degree oven on a plate or baking sheet.

Ingredients

Yield: 1 serving

1 large egg
¼ cup milk
Salt
2 slices sandwich bread
½ tablespoon unsalted butter, plus more for serving
Maple syrup, jam or other toppings, for serving

Preparation

Step 1
In a bowl or shallow dish that will fit the bread, beat the egg, milk and a pinch of salt with a fork until very smooth and bubbly on top.

Step 2
Add both bread slices (it’s OK to stack them if they don’t quite fit) and soak them, turning a few times, until the mixture is fully absorbed.

Step 3
Set a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and swirl it around the pan until it melts. The soaked bread will be really soft, so carefully pick up each slice by sliding your whole hand under it, then setting it in the pan. Cook until the bottoms are golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip the slices, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the other sides are brown, 2 to 3 minutes.

Step 4
Enjoy hot, with more butter spread over the slices and with your favorite toppings.

VI. Extra points if you add this image <https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/22/dining/21beginner-rex9/merlin_208168380_44ea7383-7d04-4d84-851b-575925088698-master768.jpg?w=1280&q=75>
VII. Now you have to give some color to your html file. In this case, you have the rules inside the `<head>` and the `<style>` tags. Change the color of the font, the size, the font, and put a background color. Any other change is also welcome! 
VIII. Now you have to upload the html file (exercise2.html) in your GitHub Repository: <https://github.com/username/DHExercise> (exercise2.html). 
IX. Check that you can see them through your GitHub Pages, <https://username.github.io/DHExercise/exercise2.html>.
