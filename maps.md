#### Shakespeare in Japan and its colonies

Japan was the first Asian country to accept Shakespeare in the nineteenth century. Shakespeare was firstly mentioned in a Dutch translation of an English grammar book in 1841. In Japan, Shakespeare's plays were accepted for its westernization movement, and linguistic and cultural reform during Meiji Restoration. Excerpt from A Midsummer Night's Dream and Romeo and Juliet were read as a public reading program in Yokohama, in 1866 and 1869.

Shakespeare's plays began to be performed in 1879 when scene from The Taming of the Shrew was performed in English in the Gaiety Theatre in Yokohama.

Japan's reception of Shakespeare impacted other Asian countries under Japan's colonialist movement. In 1903, Othello was performed as the outpost of the colonial Japanese empire in Taiwan, and Hamlet was performed in Korea by a Japanese shipa theatre company in 1909.
