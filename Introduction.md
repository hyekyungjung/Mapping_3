## About Mapping Shakespearean Adaptation in Asia Project
This project aims to create a digital map presenting various modes of Asian adaptation of Shakespeare, particularly in the Far East. Since the first Asian-language performances of Shakespeare took place in the nineteenth century within the context of modernization, Shakespeare has become one of the most frequently performed playwrights in East Asia, and Shakespearean adaptation has flourished in Asia. Many stage and movie directors have employed Shakespeare’s plays and motifs to create their own artwork, mostly with traditional Asian colors. However, in spite of these cultural phenomena, Shakespearean adaptation in Asia has been less focused and paid attention to in academia. As a result, Asia still remains marginalized in the field of Shakespeare (performance) studies. Therefore, this project pursues (re)direction and expansion of perspective on Asian adaptation of Shakespeare in the globalizing world. By bringing more attention to marginalized Asia in the dominating literature.

This project has another aim of (re)considering the role of digital humanities and DH scholars living in the twentieth century. When digital humanities was first introduced, it was thought to be one of the new threads of scholarship. However, as the contributors of Debates in the Digital Humanities 2019 discussed the necessity of DH’s active engagement in our social and political problems, this Shakespearean Adaptation Mapping project is expected to be a thread of cultural movements that provide an opportunity to bring marginalized Asian cultures and cultural products to the center and to (re)consider the equation between East and West.
